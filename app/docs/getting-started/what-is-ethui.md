# What is ethui?

ethui is a tool for interacting with Ethereum chains in a developer-friendly way.

At the surface, it replaces traditional wallets (Metamask, Rabby, etc...). But it also provides a number of features that make it more interesting for power users and developers, such as:

- An anvil-aware syncing process
- Support for test-focused wallets
