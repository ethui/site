# Installation

ethui is currently avaialable for MacOS and Linux.

## 1. Install the binary

Start by heading over to [ethui.dev](http://ethui.dev) and download the appropriate binary for your system.

## 2. Go through the onboarding

When first opening the app, you'll be greeted with an onboarding flow. This should guide you through the initial setup (wallet creation, external API keys needed, etc). All of this is optional, and can be re-configured later.

## 3. Install the extension

A companion browser extension is available:

- [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ethui/eljobehkpcnpekmbcjiidekjhkbcnpkf)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ethui/)

Once installed, the extension should connect to the app. It becomes mostly passive at that point, as any interactions are done directly in the desktop app's UI.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the extension and app communicate via websockets' port 9002

## 4. Connect to a web3 app

Go to a web3-capable site (or to our [extension setup page](https://ethui.dev/onboarding/extension)) and make sure you're able to go through the usual "Connect Wallet" flow. This means your app and extension are working and communicating correctly.
