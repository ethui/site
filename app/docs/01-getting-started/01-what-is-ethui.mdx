# What is ethui?

ethui is a tool for interacting with Ethereum chains in a developer-friendly way.

At the surface, it replaces traditional wallets (Metamask, Rabby, etc...). But it also provides a number of features that make it more interesting for power users and developers, such as:

- An [anvil][anvil]-aware syncing process
- quick feedback loops, by bypassing popups and password-prompts when testing conditions apply
- Support for test-focused wallets
- built-in contract explorer
- Automatic indexing of ABIs found in local [forge][forge] projects
