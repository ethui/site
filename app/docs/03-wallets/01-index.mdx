# TODO test wallets

ethui offers several wallet types, each with its own target use cases:

## Production-grade wallets

These are recommended for interacting with live networks, and enforce proper security measures

- [HD Wallet](/docs/wallets/hdwallet), the one you may be most familiar with if you've used Metamask, Rabby, or other popular wallet
- [Keystore](/docs/wallets/keystore), a JSON format that encodes a single private key securely in a file. A password is required to decrypt the private key
- [Private key](/docs/wallets/pkey), a single password-protected private key
- [Ledger](/docs/wallets/ledger), a hardware wallet.

## Testing wallets

These are suitable only for testing purposes. They work in live networks as well, but should be be used to hold real funds.

- [Plaintext](/docs/wallets/plaintext)
- [Impersonator](/docs/wallets/impersonator)
