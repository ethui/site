# Ledger

The `Ledger` wallet allows you to connect to a Ledger device, and sign transactions using the `eth_sendTransaction` RPC endpoint.

## Why?

Ledger devices are a popular choice for storing private keys, and are also a common choice for signing transactions.

By using the `eth_sendTransaction` RPC endpoint, ethui can automatically sign transactions using your Ledger device, without ever exposing your private key to the internet.

## How?

ethui uses the [ethers-ledger-connector][ethers-ledger-connector] library to connect to your Ledger device, and sign transactions using the `eth_sendTransaction` RPC endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> ethui does not support Ledger devices with a screen, as it is not possible to interact with them in a secure way.
