# Private Key

The `Private Key` wallet allows you to use a private key directly, without any encryption.

## Why?

This is useful for testing, as it allows you to submit transactions without having to unlock your wallet, and enables [fast mode](/docs/features/fast-mode) to work on secure wallets as well.

## How?

ethui uses the [ethers-private-key-connector][ethers-private-key-connector] library to connect to your private key, and unlock your wallet using the `eth_sendTransaction` RPC endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> ethui does not support Ledger devices with a screen, as it is not possible to interact with them in a secure way.
