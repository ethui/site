# HD Wallet

The typical mnenomic multi-address wallet you may be familiar with.
This wallet is created from a 12 or 15-word mnemonic phrase, and encrypted with a secure password.

We enforce password security through [`xcvbn-typescript`][zxcvbn-typescript], which uses the [BIP39 standard][bip39-standard] to generate the mnemonic phrase, and [scrypt][scrypt] to encrypt the wallet.
