# HDWallet

The `HDWallet` wallet allows you to use a mnemonic phrase to unlock your wallet.

## Why?

This is useful for testing, as it allows you to submit transactions without having to unlock your wallet, and enables [fast mode](/docs/features/fast-mode) to work on secure wallets as well.

## How?

ethui uses the [ethers-hdwallet-connector][ethers-hdwallet-connector] library to connect to your mnemonic phrase, and unlock your wallet using the `eth_sendTransaction` RPC endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> ethui does not support Ledger devices with a screen, as it is not possible to interact with them in a secure way.
