# Fast mode

When certain conditions are met, ethui allows for a faster approach to submitting transactions:

1. You must be connected to an anvil-based chain.
2. You must be using a [test-only wallet](/docs/02-test-wallets).

This allows ethui to skip transaction dialogs and private key decryption and directly submit an unsigned transaction to the chain.

## Why?

This is one of many improvements that enables much faster feedback loops when building a full-stack application.

The ability to quickly iterate and see real-time feedback of a user's actions is critical for a good development workflow.
