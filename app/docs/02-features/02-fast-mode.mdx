# Fast mode

When using an anvil-based chain, ethui allows for a faster approach to submitting transactions, enabled through the `Fast Mode` toggle on the sidebar.
This allows ethui to skip transaction dialogs and private key decryption and directly submit an unsigned transaction to the chain.

## Why?

This is one of many improvements that enables much faster feedback loops when building a full-stack application.

The ability to quickly iterate and see real-time feedback of a user's actions is critical for a good development workflow.
