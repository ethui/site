# Auto Impersonation

ethui automatically uses `anvil_impersonateAccount` whenever submitting transactions to an anvil-based chain.

This allows you to submit transactions without having to unlock your wallet, and enables [fast mode](/docs/features/fast-mode) to work on secure wallets as well.

## Why?

This is actually a security feature that happens to be very convenient for development.

Let's say you're spawning the following anvil node:

```sh
anvil --chain-id 1
```

This could open you up for [replay attacks](https://chain.link/education-hub/replay-attack), where you end up signing a payload that can actually end up being used on the real mainnet chain to execute a real transaction, either maliciously or by mistake.

By auto-impersonating accounts, you now skip the signing step, but are still able to include transactions on the test chain. In the end:

- you never have to actually unlock your wallet
- no signature is ever produced from your private key
- [fast mode](/docs/features/fast-mode) can now be available as well, since the confirmation steps that would be needed for a signature is now optional
