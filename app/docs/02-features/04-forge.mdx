# Forge integration

ethui automatically finds `forge` projects in your filesystem and does two things with them:

## 1. Automatic ABI indexing

All ABI files from your `<forge-project>/out` directory are automatically watched and read in real-time.
This enables ethui to synchronize with whatever contracts you're building, even if they're compiling continuously with `forge build --watch`.

## 2. Automatic contract explorer

Using the indexed ABIs, and the capabilities described in [anvil](/docs/features/anvil), ethui can automatically generate a contract explorer for your project.

It matches the on-chain bytecode for any detected contracts against ABIs found in your projects, providing you with a UI to interact with them. Think etherscan, but for your local development setup.
