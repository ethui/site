# ethui 0.6.0 ‚Äì Going Multi-chain

Since our [Rust x Eth](https://rusteth.paradigm.xyz/) talk was canceled by the airline gods, we bring you the next best thing: A fresh new release.

[TODO](https://github.com/iron-wallet/iron/releases/tag/v0.6.0)

0\.6.0 brings a bunch of new features, as well as several performance and bundle size improvements to the browser extension. Read on for the main highlights

## But first, a big thank you!

To all those who contributed to the ongoing [Gitcoin #GG18](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/424/0x222ea76664ed77d18d4416d2b2e77937b76f0a35/0x222ea76664ed77d18d4416d2b2e77937b76f0a35-31), where Iron Wallet is performing way better than we could ever anticipate ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Multi-chain routing

A big limitation of most wallets is the existence of a single global connection: you can only be in a single chain, and account, across all the dApps you're using.

Developers face this daily: developing on MetaMask + `anvil` means we can't keep a separate `mainnet` workflow on a separate tab, unless we're okay with dealing with constant popups asking us to switch back and forth. With the growth of L2s, this is increasingly a user-facing problem too.

For Iron, that ends today.

With the new chain router, each domain name stays connected to whichever chain it wants. You can still manually switch individual ones through the "Connections" page of the wallet, and you can opt-in to the previous behavior by setting domains to use the "Global" network.

### EIP-6963

We now support the recent Multi Injected Provider Discovery spec. This one was courtesy of the folks over at [wagmi](https://github.com/wagmi-dev), who authored [mipd](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/mipd) and made the work as trivial as it could possibly be.

This EIP is fairly new, and its effects won't be fully felt until most major wallets and SDKs support it, but it will eventually allow multiple extension providers to co-exist in the same browser.

This was a big limitation for Iron and other extensions and imposes a big blocker to wallet diversity

## Livenet contract tracking

Via a new form in the Contracts tab, and the Etherscan API key you can now include in the settings, you‚Äôre now able to manually add arbitrary contracts for each network.

## Lazy extension connections

Our old version of the "Connections" tab would display every single browser tab, regardless of whether the Web3 connection was used or not.

This caused visual noise, resource waste, and was also a source of confusion for some users. It is now fixed, by ensuring the connection is lazily set up. Only pages that actually trigger a Web3 request will show up.

## Some chromium nonsense finally dealt with üéâ

It‚Äôs a good feeling when a long-standing bug is finally squashed. Especially when it turns out to be the browser itself at fault.

[TODO](https://github.com/iron-wallet/iron/pull/356)

The bug in question is also considered in the MetaMask codebase, and would cause the Iron extension to sporadically fail to communicate with the desktop app. The workaround has been applied, and provider connections are now fully stable.

## What‚Äôs next?

Building. and then some more building. Hoping that next release is when we finally get to focus on transaction simulations!
