# Announcing ethui

We are launching a developer-centric crypto wallet to give web3 developers the tools they deserve.

## TL;DR

If you're a developer or any type of Ethereum power user, this will likely interest you.

Iron is a crypto wallet built, from the ground up, with development & debugging in mind. It bundles together features that, as of now, exist only as loose CLI tools and 3rd party websites and, guess what? It all runs locally on your device, with fully open-source code.

The initial version is already incredibly more powerful than alternatives as a companion to the [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) toolkit. Read on for the list of current features and to get updated on what's next.

Our aim is to make this as community-driven as possible, so your feedback and suggestions are the most important thing right now.
