# Keystore

The `Keystore` wallet allows you to use a keystore file to unlock your wallet. The keystore file format encodes a single private key in a file.

## When to use it

Choose this option when you already have a JSON keystore file (from geth, foundry, or another wallet export) and want to unlock it with a password.

## Setup

1. Export or locate your JSON keystore file.
2. In ethui, create a new wallet and select **Keystore**.
3. Choose the keystore file and enter its password.
4. Confirm the derived address before using it.

## Tips

- Treat the keystore file like a password-protected secret.
- If you lose the password, the keystore cannot be recovered.
