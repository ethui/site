# Impersonator

The `Impersonator` wallet allows you to impersonate any account on the chain, by using the `anvil_impersonateAccount` RPC endpoint.

This is useful for testing, as it allows you to submit transactions without having to unlock your wallet, and enables [fast mode](/docs/features/fast-mode) to work on secure wallets as well.

## How it works

The wallet sends `anvil_impersonateAccount` for the address you choose, so you can run transactions as that account without signing locally.

## Setup

1. Start an anvil node.
2. Create a new wallet and select **Impersonator**.
3. Enter the address you want to impersonate.
4. Submit transactions as usual.

For the background on why this is safe and how it avoids signing, see [Auto Impersonation](/docs/features/auto-impersonation).
