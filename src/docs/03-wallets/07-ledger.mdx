# Ledger

The `Ledger` wallet allows you to connect to a Ledger device. Currently, this is the only type of hardware wallet supported.

## Setup

1. Connect your Ledger device via USB.
2. Unlock it and open the Ethereum app.
3. In ethui, create a new wallet and select **Ledger**.
4. Choose the account path and confirm the address on the device.

## Troubleshooting

- If the device is not detected, reconnect the cable and reopen the Ethereum app.
- Make sure the Ledger firmware and Ethereum app are up to date.
