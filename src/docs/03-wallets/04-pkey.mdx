# Private Key

The `Private Key` wallet allows you to use a single private key directly.

While this method is secure (the key is password-protected), it is not the most convenient or recommended way to use a wallet. It is supported only for scenarios where a user already has a private key and needs to access it.

## Setup

1. Copy your private key from a trusted source.
2. In ethui, create a new wallet and select **Private Key**.
3. Paste the key and set a strong password.
4. Verify the derived address matches your expected account.

## Security notes

- Only paste keys on a trusted machine.
- Prefer keystore or hardware wallets for long-term use.
