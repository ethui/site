# Lazy Loaded Private Keys

In most web3 wallets, you're forced to input your password when you first open the wallet. ethui handles this differently.

Because it allows for multiple wallets of various types, and because a wallet unlock is not strictly necessary for a lot of flows, we defer this step until it is actually needed.

In practice, this means that when a signature is needed from a secure wallet, we first request an account unlock (prompting you for the password), and then cache it in-memory for a few minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> The in-memory cached key is stored as securely as possible, using the [secrets][secrets-crate] to isolate it in-memory as much as possible and avoid leaks
