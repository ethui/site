# ethui 1.27

We're happy to announce the release of ethui 1.27.

The highlight is hardhat support, which was finally possible after addressing some low hanging fruit, but there's also good news for the browser extension.

# Hardhat support

`anvil` RPC endpoints such as `anvil_mine` and `anvil_impersonateAccount` are mostly aliases to hardhat equivalent RPCs, so supporting both types of development nodes is actually pretty simple.

The main difficulty was in seamlessly handling compilation artifacts in our [filesystem ABI sync][abi-sync] feature, which we finally were able to implement after a series of updates to the underlying logic.

## Some love for the extension

The ethui browser extension has always served purely as a proxy to the desktop app.

However, this made onboarding a bit more painful, since users needed to first install the app, which prompts you back to a browser to install the extension.

We've now inverted this flow, meaning you can easily install the extension first, where you're now prompted directly to the download action.

We have also laid the groundwork for an upcoming feature where the extension will start to be useful on its own, and potentially be enough for simpler use cases, resulting in a much faster setup flow for new users.
